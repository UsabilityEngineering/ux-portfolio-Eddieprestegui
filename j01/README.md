# Making a 3D Design 
So today I will be creating a 3D design using [Blender](https://www.blender.org). Blender is a powerful open-source (FREE!!!) computer software used for 3D effects, animation, visual effects, and pretty much anything you can think of. Learning Blender can be a bit frustrating at first, but as I continue to practice my skills the **learnability** (especially key commands) help speed up the workflow. 

The two main workpace features I will be using are the [layout](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/workspaces.html) and [shading](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/workspaces.html) features. When we open a new project we will see a default screen with three objects: a cube, a camera, and a light. For now, I’ll just delete the cube and light by selecting the cube and *shift-clicking* the light and then *pressing x* and clicking on *delete*. Looking at Blender’s **visual mapping** we can distinguish what each feature may do by how it looks. The icons help a lot, you could almost predict what it could do based on how it appears. The main components are in the middle, and the edit options are on the right and left side, it's pretty obvious that we are using the middle part as the main focus area.

Let’s add our text! Finding out how to add a text should be straightfoward. You could select *add* (under layout) or use the key command *shift a* and select text, simple right. To change the viewport, so I can see the text from above, select the *z-axis* (making sure it’s in the positive value). To edit our text *press tab* and for now I’ll use “UX” as our design and *press tab* again to change from edit mode to object mode.
