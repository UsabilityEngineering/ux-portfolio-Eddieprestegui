# Making a 3D Design 
So today I will be creating a 3D design using [Blender](https://www.blender.org). Blender is a powerful open-source (FREE!!!) computer software used for 3D effects, animation, visual effects, and pretty much anything you can think of. Learning Blender can be a bit frustrating at first, but if you continue to practice your skills it's **learnability** (especially key commands) helps speed up the workflow. 

The two main workspace features I will be using are the [layout](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/workspaces.html) and [shading](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/workspaces.html) features. When we open a new project we will see a default screen with three objects: a cube, a camera, and a light. For now, I’ll just delete the cube and light by selecting the cube and *shift-clicking* the light and then *pressing x* and click on *delete*. With just the camera left we can take a break and observe Blender’s **visual mapping**, we can distinguish what each feature may do by how it looks. The icons help a lot, you could almost predict what it could do based on how it appears. The main components are in the middle, and the edit options are on the right and left side, it's pretty obvious that we are using the middle part as the main focus area.

Before we move on, make sure to save your project by:
1. Pressing *command s*
2. Pick your destination (I recommend your desktop so it's easily accessible)
3. Name it
4. & finally select save blender file 

A friendly reminder to press *command s* every 5 minutes or so, that way if your project randomly crashes you have the most recent version of your project. 

Let’s add our text! Finding out how to add text should be straightforward. You could select *add* (under layout) or use the key command *shift a* and select the text, simple right. To change the viewport, so I can see the text from above, select the *z-axis* (making sure it’s in the positive value). To edit our text *press tab* and for now, I’ll use “UX” as our design and *press tab* again to change from edit mode to object mode.
