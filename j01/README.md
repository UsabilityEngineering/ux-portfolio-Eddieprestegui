# Making a 3D Design 
So today I will be creating a 3D design using [Blender] (https://www.blender.org). Blender is a powerful open-source (FREE!!!) computer software used for 3D effects, animation, visual effects, and pretty much anything you can think of. Learning Blender can be a bit frustrating at first, but as I continue to practice my skills it's **learnability** of key commands help speed up the workflow.

The two main features I will be using are the layout and shading features. When we open a new project we will see a default screen with three objects: a cube, a camera, and a light. For now, I’ll just delete the cube and light by selecting the cube and *shift-clicking* the light and then *press x* and click on *delete*. Looking at Blender’s **visual mapping** we can distinguish what each feature may do by its name. The icons also help a lot, you could almost predict what it could do based on how it looks. The main components are in the middle, and the edit options are on the right and left side, it's pretty obvious that we are using the middle part as the main focus area.
